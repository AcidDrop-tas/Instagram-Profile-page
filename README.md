# Instagram User Profile Clone (Posts Section)

This project is a **responsive clone** of the Instagram user profile page under the "Posts" section. It is built purely with **HTML** and **CSS**, with no frameworks or libraries. The project is designed as a learning exercise to practice the basics of front-end development.

## Features

- **Static Design**: Mimics the layout and style of Instagram's user profile posts section.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and tablet), though mobile devices are not fully accounted for.
- **Hover Effects**: Includes simple hover effects for interactivity (e.g., underlines for links in the footer).
- **Flexbox Practice**: Uses CSS Flexbox for layout and alignment.
- **Typography and Styling**: Designed with attention to fonts, colors, and spacing to resemble Instagram's aesthetic.

## Personal Notes

This project was a great opportunity to practice the basics of front-end development. It reflects my current level of experience and has helped me better understand responsive design and layout techniques. I'm excited to build on this foundation and improve in future projects.
